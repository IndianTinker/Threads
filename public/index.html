      Welcome to "Threads" - an interactive installation by <a href="http://rohitg.in/portfolio/" target="_blank"
        class="link dim light-purple">Rohit</a> at <a href="http://2019.functionfest.com/" class="link dim light-purple"
        target="_blank">function()</a>. <br>
    </p>

    <div class="pt4-ns pt3 f5-ns f5 b">How</div>
    <p class="mt1-ns mt1 lh-copy f4-ns f5 ">
      Click on the 'Play' link on the top. You will then be connected with the function() location. <br> As you move
      your
      finger across the screen, interesting patterns emerge to amuse you. They in-turn affect the installation at the
      gallery by altering the space there. This introduces you in <span class='i'>mediated connection</span> with
      the gallery. I use this
      "mediated connection" as a metaphor for the communications we have today.
      <br> <br>
      You should take screenshots of any interesting patterns to find. :)

    <div class="pt4-ns pt3 f5-ns f5 b">What</div>
    <p class="mt1-ns mt1 lh-copy f4-ns f5 ">
      In today’s digitally
      submersed life, human connections and perceptions have been mediated to an extent that it is
      challenging the subjective uniqueness of an individual. We seem to be so busy doing nothing but communicating.
      <br>
      We are surrounded, trapped, and amused by these multitude of 'threads' around us.
